# Flux Law: Mathematical Equivalence Verification

## Purpose

This module provides rigorous mathematical verification that
**Standard General Relativity** and **Lapse-First General Relativity**
(GATG approach) are mathematically equivalent for flux conservation laws.

## What It Does

The module performs symbolic computation to prove that two different
starting points yield identical flux conservation:

### Standard GR Approach

```markdown
Stress-energy tensor → Covariant conservation → ∇μT^μν = 0 → Flux laws
```

### Lapse-First GR (GATG) Approach

```markdown
Temporal potential Φ → Flux through temporal geometry → Conservation laws
```

**Verification Results:**

- Both approaches yield identical **energy conservation** laws
- Both produce the same **momentum flux** equations
- Both satisfy identical **continuity equations**
- Both derive the same **Vaidya spacetime** dynamics

## Why This Verification Matters

This proves mathematical equivalence between the standard stress-energy
conservation approach and the lapse-first temporal geometry reformulation
for flux conservation laws, demonstrating that the GATG formulation
correctly reproduces all conservation properties of General Relativity.
