# Schwarzschild Solution: Mathematical Equivalence Verification

## Purpose

This module provides rigorous mathematical verification that
Standard General Relativity** and **Lapse-First General Relativity**
(GATG approach) are mathematically equivalent for the Schwarzschild solution.

## What It Does

The module performs symbolic computation to prove that two different
starting points yield identical Schwarzschild spacetime:

### Standard GR Approach

```markdown
Spherically symmetric metric → Einstein equations → ODE → A(r) = 1 - r_s/r
```

### Lapse-First GR (GATG) Approach

```markdown
Temporal potential Φ → Lapse function N = e^Φ → Metric construction → A(r) = 1 - r_s/r
```

**Verification Results:**

- Both approaches yield the identical **metric tensor**
- Both satisfy the same **fundamental ODE**: r A'(r) + A(r) - 1 = 0
- Both satisfy **Einstein vacuum equations**: G_μν = 0
- Both produce the same **Schwarzschild radius**: r_s = 2GM/c²

## Why This Verification Matters

This proves mathematical equivalence between the standard Einstein field equation
approach and the lapse-first temporal geometry reformulation for the most important
exact solution in General Relativity.
The GATG reformulation reduces the complexity from solving 10 coupled Einstein equations
to a single simple ODE.
