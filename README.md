# GATG: Gravity as Temporal Geometry - Equivalence Verification and Theoretical Exploration

## Purpose

This project has two complementary scientific goals:

### Goal 1: Mathematical Equivalence Verification

Provide comprehensive mathematical verification that
**Gravity as Temporal Geometry (GATG)**,
a lapse-first reformulation of General Relativity,
is mathematically equivalent to **Standard General Relativity**
across all fundamental scenarios.

**Equivalence Target:** Prove that two different approaches to
General Relativity yield identical physical results:

1. **Standard GR**: Einstein's 4D spacetime approach with 10 coupled field equations
2. **Lapse-First GR (GATG)**: Temporal geometry approach starting from temporal potential Φ

### Goal 2: Theoretical Exploration and Experimental Support

Explore theoretical implications of the lapse-first reformulation and
develop experimental protocols to test unique predictions.

**Research Targets:**
- **Quantum Origin**: Fixed-point emergence of classical spacetime
- **Gravitational Dephasing**: Precision atomic clock signatures
- **Quantum Witnesses**: Commutator protocols for temporal geometry testing
- **Novel Physics**: Insights from the temporal potential perspective
- **Experimental Predictions**: Laboratory and astronomical tests

## Key Scientific Insight

The most profound demonstration of equivalence is the **Schwarzschild solution**:

- **Standard GR**: Requires solving 10 complex coupled Einstein equations
- **GATG**: Reduces to a single simple ODE: `r A'(r) + A(r) - 1 = 0`

Both yield the identical Schwarzschild metric, proving mathematical equivalence
while revealing the deeper geometric structure of gravity.

## What This Project Accomplishes

### Mathematical Equivalence (Goal 1)

Equivalence verification modules demonstrate that Standard GR and GATG are mathematically identical, producing:

- ✓ Identical **metric tensors** across all spacetime geometries
- ✓ Identical **field equations** and their solutions
- ✓ Identical **experimental predictions** for all observable effects
- ✓ Identical **conservation laws** and physical principles
- ✓ Identical **degrees of freedom** and propagation properties

**Computational Advantage:** The GATG approach often provides simpler paths to solutions while maintaining full mathematical rigor.

### Theoretical Exploration and Experimental Support (Goal 2)

Research modules explore unique implications of the lapse-first reformulation:

- ✓ **Quantum Origin**: Mathematical framework for fixed-point emergence of classical spacetime from quantum substrate
- ✓ **Screening Physics**: Rigorous Banach contraction theory with observational constraints (ξ ≥ 10¹¹ m)
- ✓ **Dephasing Predictions**: Observable gravitational dephasing in precision atomic clock networks
- ✓ **Quantum Witnesses**: Commutator-based detection protocols for temporal geometry signatures
- ✓ **Experimental Protocols**: Complete measurement frameworks for laboratory and astronomical tests

**Novel Physics:** These modules provide theoretical insights and experimental predictions that emerge naturally from the temporal potential perspective while remaining consistent with established GR.

## Scientific Methodology

### Rigorous Symbolic Computation

**All modules use SageMath symbolic mathematics exclusively:**

- ❌ **Prohibited**: Synthetic data, random values, hardcoded approximations
- ✅ **Required**: Symbolic derivation, exact computation, mathematical proof

### Verification Pattern

Each module follows the same rigorous structure:

1. **Standard GR computation** using traditional 4D spacetime methods
2. **Lapse-First GR computation** using temporal potential approach
3. **Mathematical comparison** proving exact equivalence
4. **Verification script** confirming equivalence automatically

## Usage

### Requirements

- **SageMath** (symbolic computation environment)
- All scripts must be run with: `sage -python script.py`

### Running Verifications

**Individual module verification:**
```bash
cd schwarzschild/
sage -python verification.py
```

**Expected output for all modules:**
```markdown
✓ EQUIVALENCE VERIFIED: Standard GR ≡ Lapse-First GR
✓ [MODULE-SPECIFIC CONFIRMATION]
```

This comprehensive project demonstrates that:

1. **GATG is mathematically equivalent to General Relativity** across all fundamental scenarios
2. **The temporal potential approach** often provides simpler computational paths to solutions
3. **All experimental predictions** of standard GR remain identical between formulations
4. **Novel theoretical insights** emerge from the lapse-first perspective
5. **Experimental protocols** enable testing of quantum-to-classical emergence predictions

The project establishes GATG as a mathematically rigorous reformulation
of General Relativity with computational advantages while preserving
all physical content of Einstein's theory, and explores theoretical implications
including quantum origin and experimental signatures.

Every computation in this project uses symbolic mathematics with no approximations,
ensuring the equivalence proofs are mathematically exact and scientifically rigorous.
