# GATG Project Dependencies
# Install with: sage -pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or within SageMath environment: pip install -r requirements.txt

# CORE REQUIREMENT: SageMath
# SageMath must be installed first via:
#   - conda install -c conda-forge sage
#   - or system package manager (apt, brew, etc.)
#   - or download from sagemath.org
#
# All computations use SageMath's symbolic mathematics engine
# and all scripts must be run with: sage -python script.py

# Testing framework (only dependency beyond SageMath)
pytest>=6.0.0

# Note: This project uses ONLY SageMath for all computations
# All mathematical operations use symbolic computation via sage.all
# No external numerical libraries (numpy, scipy) are required
# No external symbolic libraries (sympy) are required
# No cosmology-specific packages are used
# All functionality is implemented through SageMath's comprehensive
# mathematical framework for rigorous symbolic verification
