# Experimental Predictions: Mathematical Equivalence Verification

## Purpose

This module provides rigorous mathematical verification that
**Standard General Relativity** and **Lapse-First General Relativity**
(GATG approach) are mathematically equivalent for experimental predictions.

## What It Does

The module performs symbolic computation to prove that two different
starting points yield identical experimental observables:

### Standard GR Approach

```markdown
Metric solutions → Geodesics → Observable effects → Experimental predictions
```

### Lapse-First GR (GATG) Approach

```markdown
Temporal potential Φ → Lapse dynamics → Physical observables → Experimental predictions
```

**Verification Results:**

- Both approaches yield identical **perihelion precession** rates
- Both predict the same **light deflection** angles
- Both produce identical **gravitational redshift** formulas
- Both generate the same **time dilation** effects

## Why This Verification Matters

This proves mathematical equivalence between the standard metric approach
and the lapse-first temporal geometry reformulation for all experimentally
testable predictions, demonstrating that the GATG formulation produces
identical observable consequences as General Relativity.
